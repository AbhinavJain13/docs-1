Facebook Login
==============

Pre-requisites
--------------

* To use Facebook login with Hasura, create an App on Facebook from
  https://developers.facebook.com/.

* In the newly created app's page, and obtain the "App ID" and "App Secret"
  values.

* Now you need to configure Hasura Auth service with these credentials.

* To configure, go to auth.yaml in clusters/<cluster-name> directory.

* Under ``facebook``, set ``clientId`` and ``clientSecret``

.. code-block:: yaml

      facebook:
        clientId: "String"
        clientSecret: "String"

* Choose your device and Facebook SDK from here:
  https://developers.google.com/identity/choose-auth


Web apps
--------

For web apps, use the Facebook Login for Web Javascript SDK to integrate with
Hasura Auth.

See here on how to use it:
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/web/

Mobile apps
-----------

For mobile apps, you Facebook mobile SDKs to integrate with Hasura Auth.

See here on how to use it:

* Android: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android/
* iOS: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/ios/


Login/Signup a user with Hasura Auth
------------------------------------

* Use Facebook SDK from above to obtain ``accessToken`` (or ``access_token``)
  of the logged in Facebook user.

* Once the ``access_token`` is obtained, send the ``access_token`` to Hasura Auth
  service:

  .. code:: http

   POST auth.<project-name>.hasura-app.io/v2/signup HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "provider" : "facebook",
     "data" : {
        "access_token": "String",
     }
   }


* If successful, this will return a response as follows:

  .. code:: http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "auth_token": "tpdq0m9whrj7i4vcjn48zq43bqx2",
      "hasura_roles": [
        "user"
      ],
      "hasura_id": 79,
      "new_user": true
    }


* If the user is a new user, ``new_user`` will be true, else false.


* To check if the current user is logged in, make a call to:
  ``/user/account/info``.

* To logout, make a call to ``/user/logout``.

* To get Hasura credentials of current logged in user, ``/user/account/info``.
