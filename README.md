To build, contribute and view docs:

* Make sure you have `pip` installed on your system

* Install Sphinx
```
pip3 install Sphinx
```

* Now build the docs to produce HTML files. Inside the docs folder:
```
make html
```

* The generated docs are in `_build/html`. Navigate to the HTML files by using
a webserver or opening them in the browser. Eg: ``cd _build/html && http-server``
