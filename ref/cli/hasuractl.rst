HasuraCTL
=========

``hasuractl`` is the commandline tool for the Hasura platform. 

Installation
------------

* Install latest ``kubectl`` (>= 1.6.0) (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/kubectl/install/)


* Install ``hasuractl`` on Windows:

    Download `hasuractl.exe <https://storage.googleapis.com/hasuractl/v0.1.9/windows-amd64/hasuractl.exe>`_ and place it in your ``PATH``. Refer to this `video reference <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_G1GgYOqazYUDJFcVhmNHE1UnM/view>`_ if you need help with the installation on Windows.

* Install ``hasuractl`` on Linux:

.. code::

    $ curl -Lo hasuractl https://storage.googleapis.com/hasuractl/v0.1.9/linux-amd64/hasuractl && chmod +x hasuractl && sudo mv hasuractl /usr/local/bin/

Feel free to leave off the ``sudo mv hasuractl /usr/local/bin`` if you would like to add hasuractl to your path manually

* Install ``hasuractl`` on Mac:

.. code::

    $ curl -Lo hasuractl https://storage.googleapis.com/hasuractl/v0.1.9/darwin-amd64/hasuractl && chmod +x hasuractl && sudo mv hasuractl /usr/local/bin/

Feel free to leave off the ``sudo mv hasuractl /usr/local/bin`` if you would like to add hasuractl to your path manually

NOTE:
-----

- If you are on windows, you should only use git-bash to execute commands that you see in this documentation.
- If you already have hasuractl installed, replace the old binary with the new one.

Starting hasura
---------------

1. Create an account at `dashboard.hasura.io <https://dashboard.hasura.io>`_ if you do not have one.

2. Run:

.. code::

   $ hasuractl login

3. Set context: 

   You will need to create a Hasura project for the next step. You can do that
   at `dashboard.hasura.io <https://dashboard.hasura.io/projects>`_.

   Set your project context using 

.. code::

   $ hasuractl set-context <project-name>

Here <project-name> is the name of the project you created on the Hasura
Dashboard. This command also sets the kubectl context (which can be skipped using the -k flag).

Frequently Used Commands
-------------------------
add-ssh-key
~~~~~~~~~~~
This command picks the public key (id_rsa.pub) and adds it to the Hasura project. 
The ssh key can be generated using 

.. code::

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

After this run 

.. code::

    $ hasuractl add-ssh-key

to add the ssh key to your Hasura project.

quickstart
~~~~~~~~~~
This command will initialize projects from templates from https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git into a local directory.
It will also initialize a git repository inside the directory. Along with this, if the --create flag is passed, a git-push microservice 
will also be created.

The command can be used as

.. code::

    $ hasuractl quickstart <template> <app-name> [--create] [-l|--location <path>]

**Example:**

Let's say that you want to make a nodejs express app on Hasura. You can use a template available on 
https://github.com/hasura/quickstart-docker-git to start off quickly. To simplify the process of cloning the repo, copying the 
nodejs-express into your working directory and initializing a git repo inside the directory, you can use the hasuractl quickstart command. 
If you also want to create a git-push service for the app, you can pass a --create flag to the quickstart command. The command will look like

.. code::

    $ hasuractl quickstart nodejs-express myapp --create

This will initialize a nodejs-express app in ./myapp, initialize a git repository and create a git-push microservice named 'myapp'.


To list the available templates use

.. code::

    $ hasuractl quickstart list


forward
~~~~~~~
This command forwards a given port on the local machine to the given service and port in the hasura cluster.
It works in the same manner as how ssh -L does.
The format of the command is

.. code::

    $ hasuractl forward [<local-port>:<service-name>.<namespace>:<service-port>]...

This will expose <service-name>:<service-port> at localhost:<local-port>.

**Example:**

Let's say that you're working on an app and you need to access your postgres database. Normally you'll have to ssh into the 
postgres pod inside the cluster and then run psql to access the database. Using the hasuractl forward command, you can expose the 
postgres service running inside the cluster to a port on your local machine. Normally the postgres service will be running on  
port 5432 in the namespace 'hasura'. You want to access it locally on port 5432. The command to run will be

.. code:: 

    $ hasuractl forward 5432:postgres.hasura:5432

In the argument being passed to forward, 5432:postgres.hasura:5432, the first number is the local port and the last one is the port where 
the postgres service inside the hasura namespace is exposed.

Let's say you have a service 'myapp' running on port 8080 inside the cluster. Say you want to be able to access 'myapp' locally 
on port 8081. You'll want to forward your local port 8081 to port 8080 of 'myapp'. The service 'myapp' will normally be in the 
namespace 'default'. The command to forward will be

.. code:: 

    $ hasuractl forward 8081:myapp.default:8080

Finally, say you want to expose both the services above locally. Instead of running two instances of the hasuractl forward command, 
you can combine them into a single command like this

.. code:: 

    $ hasuractl forward 8081:myapp.default:8080 5432:postgres.hasura:5432

set-context
~~~~~~~~~~~
This command sets the hasuractl and kubectl context to the given project. Please note that you'll have to login to your Hasura account 
before running this command. 

.. code:: 

    $ hasuractl set-context <project-name> [-k]

Passing the -k flag will skip setting the kubectl context and will only set the hasuractl context.

get-context
~~~~~~~~~~~
This command will display the current hasuractl and kubectl contexts.
